**Purpose**

The purpose of the portfolio website is to provide visibility of my skills, interests and experience to potential employers. Creating a portfolio to highlight my work will assist in providing opportunities into the information technology industry. As an aspiring developer, the portfolio website exhibits web development and design capabilities. 

**Functionality/Features**

**1. Navigation**

A navigation bar is located at the top of the each page to provide accessibility across the content on the portfolio website. The navigation bar provides the user a list of available webpages on the portfolio websit; these links include: Home (via logo), About, Projects, Blog and Contact. 

Depending on the user's current page; the current page will be highlighted in a different color to indicate to the user what page they are currently viewing. Additionality the hover effect (highlight) provided in the navigation bar is to provide an interactive experience for the user and also indicate to the user that the element is interactable (clickable).

**2. Animation**

Animations are provided across the porfolio to indiciate to the user that an element is interactable, provide a sense of direction or keeps the user interested. Animations that have been implemented into the portfolio site include colour changes, transformation or breathing. 

Breathing effect: Implemented on the main home page on the logo to provide a night cityscape vibe like the featured background of the cityscape. The breathing effect was implemented to imitate the signalling lights on top of buildings for aeroplanes. 

Colour change effect: Implemented on the navigation bar, project cards and about skills and locations. The colour change effect was implemented to indicate to the user that the element is interactable. 

Transformation effect: Implemented on the main and contact page. The transformation effect was implemented to draw the user attention to elements that are important and that the element is interactable.

Bounce effect: Implemented on the chevron on the contact page. The bounce effect is to indicate direction to the user that the elements beneath the animation is interactable.

**3. External links**

External links are provided throughout the website to direct the user to provide more information that are not explicitly provided on the portfolio. Some external links include access to GitHub or LinkedIn.
